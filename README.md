# Comfy Sloth

An e-commerce website with stripe payment and authentication using ReactJS, Stripe, and Auth0. It was deployed using Netlify.

This is from John Smilga's React course. From this course, I learned a lot about React especially the fundamentals.

- State management
- Props
- Hooks
- Reducers, Context
- JSX
- Functional Components
- Handling Events
- Forms
- Conditional Rendering
- Working with third-party APIs
- Router
- Refs

I did not just copy paste code, I make sure that I understand first. I upload this to be a reference in my future projects.
My biggest challenge in this project is the Stripe API. In the future, I'll always make sure to read the docs.
